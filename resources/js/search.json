Do this for all images excluding empty and duplicate ones.","Correct, correct and correct! Use the waveform feature to correct. Trust me this tool will make it 100 times easier.

(Make sure to uncheck fit picture to frame otherwise the photo will be cropped which we really don't want).","Now we will seperate the duplicate and empty image files using Adobe Bridge. Use the label feature of adobe bridge to label the images apart from the duplicate and empty ones and do sort by label.
