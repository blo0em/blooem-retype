# SAT Reading Prep

Some materials that will help in preparing for the reading section of SAT.
ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ                        
!!!warning This guide was meant for the traditional SAT exam aka the one we have been giving until 2022. Since digital SAT is a thing now, I'm not sure what the new pattern is, but I'm sure these will definitely help improve your comprehension as well as overall English skill. So, regardless of which SAT you're taking these resources should prove themselves helpful.

SAT data analysis questions overall, they nevertheless require many of the same skills tested
